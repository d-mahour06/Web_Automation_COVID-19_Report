# Web_Automation_COVID-19_Report
This is a bot which will scrap the covid-19 recover-death rate data from the web using UiPath Studio.

Let's talk in some detail, so basically this is a Web Automation using UiPath, a RPA Project. In this project, the bot will scrap the data of recover-death rate of COVID-19 over the worldwide from the web search, covid 19 data, on the browser and save the extracted data into a variable and then create a new excel spreadsheet and the bot will pass the variable, in which the extracted data was stored, to the excel file and save it.

Hope you'll like my project.
Thank You
